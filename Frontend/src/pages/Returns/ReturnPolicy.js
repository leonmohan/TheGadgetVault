                    Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.
                    To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.

                    To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.

                    Refunds (if applicable)
                    Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
                    If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

                    Late or missing refunds (if applicable)
                    If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
                    Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
                    Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
                    If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at thegadgetvaultsupport@email.com.

                    Exchanges (if applicable)
                    We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at thegadgetvaultsupport@email.com and send your item to 22 Gadget Vault Road.

                    Gifts
                    If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.

                    Shipping
                    To return your product, you should mail your product to 22 Gadget Vault Road.
                    You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

                    Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.

                    If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
